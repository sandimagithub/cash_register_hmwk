## Cash Register
 
####Step 1
Create a cash register page which takes in prices from an input, then adds them do the page using javascript, and adds up the total of all the prices. Starter code is in `code/cash_register`

  * how will you GET input from the user?
  * how will you keep track of totals?
  * how will you add/update the total on the page?



####Step 2
Create 2 inputs, one for the name of the item, one for the price. Render the items and prices on the receipt.

####Advanced
Use an array to keep track of all elements. Add a "-" button next to each item to remove the item from the receipt, which also updates the total correctly.
